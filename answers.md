**1. Improving the model with only 200 labeled replies:**  
I would use data augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, back-translation, or paraphrasing to increase dataset diversity. Additionally, I could leverage transfer learning with a pre-trained transformer (e.g., DistilBERT) and fine-tune it on the small dataset, as pre-trained models can generalize well from limited labeled data. Semi-supervised learning or active learning could also be applied to iteratively label the most informative samples.

**2. Ensuring the reply classifier is unbiased and safe:**  
I would carefully curate the training data to avoid over-representation of specific groups or sensitive content. Implementing content filtering, adversarial testing, and monitoring predictions for harmful, biased, or unsafe outputs in production would help maintain fairness and safety. Periodic audits and updating the model with diverse, real-world data also reduce bias over time.

**3. Prompt design strategies for generating personalized cold email openers:**  
I would include explicit instructions in the prompt to reference recipient-specific information (e.g., company, role, or interests) while avoiding generic phrasing. Providing a few concrete examples of high-quality, personalized openers helps guide the LLM to produce relevant outputs. Constraints on tone, length, and style can also be included to ensure consistent, professional messaging.
